# AD-TFM-AT-Model  
Detection of incipient faults in power distribution network (LSTM/Adaptive Wavelet trasnform/Attention).
# Requirement  
* Python 3.6  
* Tensorflow-gpu 1.14.0  
* Keras 2.25  
# Train the model  
Run command below to train the model:  

`<python test_tf.py> `  

# Experiment  
Datasets are obtained from a small Incipient Fault dataset in Power Distribution (IFPD) system from , and a relatively large dataset logged by State Grid Corporation of China in AnHui Province (SGAH) from .

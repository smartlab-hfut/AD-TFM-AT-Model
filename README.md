# AD-TFM-AT-Model  
Detection of incipient faults in power distribution network (LSTM/Adaptive Wavelet trasnform/Attention).
# Requirement  
* Python 3.6  
* Tensorflow-gpu 1.14.0  
* Keras 2.25  
# Train the model  
Run command below to train the model:  

`python test_tf.py`  

# Experiment  
Datasets are obtained from a small Incipient Fault dataset in Power Distribution (IFPD) system from [1] (https://dx.doi.org/10.21227/bwjy-7e05), and a relatively large dataset logged by State Grid Corporation of China in AnHui Province (SGAH) from [2] (https://github.com/smartlab-hfut/SGAH-datasets.git).
